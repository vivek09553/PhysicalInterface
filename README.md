Physical Interface Module PI LV 2

Aim :
To explore and understand the practicality of Physical Interfaces in prespective of
interactive designing using basic 3D shapes.

Objective :

Arduino : 
Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a micro controller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

Processing : 
Processing is a programming language designed for the visual arts community. It is open source and uses basic syntax for creating drawings, animations, and interactive programs. It also includes a basic IDE, which serves as the programming interface.

Arduino Processing Serial Communication :
The Arduino IDE and the processing IDE will communicate with each other through serial communication. The processing IDE has a serial library which makes it easy to communicate with Arduino.

Materials Required :

1. Arduino Uno
2. Bread Board
3. Wires
4. Fire Sensor
5. Rain Sensor

Software : 
1. Processing IDE  : https://processing.org/download/
2. Ardunio IDE        : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Language Required :
C and Java

Working :

Fire Sensor : When  sensor detects flames make gives a spins the cube left to right in the art board

Rain Water Sensor : When sensor detects moisture or water spins the cube from vertices in the art board

Default : A complex cube structure rotates along y-axis
